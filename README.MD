   This program calculates fibonacci numbers. First, the program
   will ask for the user's name and use this name for the hello and goodbye
   messages.  The program will also prompt the user to enter the number of
   fibonacci terms they want to see (in the range of 1 to 46). The program
   will calculate and display the numbers to the screen, and exit with
   a goodbye message to the user.

  ** Program displays the numbers in aligned columns.
  ** Program colours each row differently
